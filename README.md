### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Machine Learning & Natural Language Processing at UKP Lab in TU Darmstadt, supervised by Prof. Iryna Gurevych. My Ph.D. topic is reasoning in LLMs. I am also interested in the security aspects of LLMs, such as data leaks and jailbreaking. Previously, I worked at the Coleridge Initiative, where I co-organized the Kaggle Competition Show US the Data. I got my master's degree from the School of Computing at KAIST, where I was a research assistant at IR&NLP Lab and advised by Professor Sung-Hyon Myaeng.
