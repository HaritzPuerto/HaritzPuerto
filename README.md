### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a final-year Ph.D. candidate in Machine Learning & Natural Language Processing at UKP Lab in TU Darmstadt, supervised by Prof. Iryna Gurevych. My research focuses on advancing reasoning and enhancing explainability in large language models, aiming to develop next-generation AI systems capable of helping humans solving complex tasks. During my Ph.D., I have interned at Parameter Lab, where we worked with Naver AI on trustworthy AI. Before my Ph.D., I worked at the Coleridge Initiative, where I co-organized the Kaggle Competition Show US the Data. I got my master's degree from the School of Computing at KAIST, where I was a research assistant at IR&NLP Lab and was advised by Professor Sung-Hyon Myaeng.
